## Problem Title
Problem 1: Web server (with optional secure communication).

## Problem objective
Design a basic HTTP web-server application which can listen on a configurable TCP port and serve both static HTML and dynamically generated HTML by means of a chosen programming language, such as in the way Apache uses PHP. It is acceptable for this server application to support only a restricted subset of HTTP, such as GET or POST requests, and the only headers it must support are Content-Type and Content-Length.

### Technologies
 The following Technologies and programming languages were used to meet the above objectives.
 - Javascript Progranning Language
 - React js Framework(for the home and signup pages)
 - Node js runtime environment
 - Axios Library
 - Express js Framework
 - Cors middleware(to secure the routes on the web-server)
 - bcrypt library to encrypt the data
 - mysql db
 - vsCode code editor

## Results
The client side code produces the below results when run on the browser on localhost
